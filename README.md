# Box2D Test with Objects
An organized (divided by classes separated per files) cross-platform (Windows, Linux, PS Vita) sample project of using Box2D with SDL2.

## Controls
### For Desktops
- <kbd>R</kbd> - reset box position.
- <kbd>WASD</kbd> or <kbd>Arrows</kbd> - move camera.
- <kbd>Q</kbd>/<kbd>E</kbd> - adjust zoom.

### For PS Vita
- <kbd>Cross</kbd> - reset box position.
- <kbd>Left Stick</kbd> or <kbd>DPAD</kbd> - move camera.
- <kbd>L</kbd>/<kbd>R</kbd> or <kbd>Right Stick</kbd> - adjust zoom.

## Known issues
All the program itself is behaving strange at this time. In future it's necessary to resolve the physics calculations and\or rendering problems, because right now this program can't be taken seriously.
